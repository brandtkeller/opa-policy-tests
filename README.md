# opa-policy-tests
Repository for testing some json parsing and rego policy logic

## Hypothesis
Through the use of OPA/Rego - would could open up the possibility of validating any payload that we can receive or transform to JSON. Initial test cases would be kubernetes API adapter and AWS adapter - but this doesn't mean a generic REST/http adapter would be off the table either. This means that others could potentially setup transformers of data for validation purposes as long as it can produce a JSON payload. IE a daemonset with access to the OS that exposes an API for validating OS configurations. 

## Match
What does a match mean in this context?

If we're writing our policy to meet parity with what we have today - we need the ability to:
- Look at all pods
- process exclusions
- process rego to define that all pods must have 1 container that includes `istio/proxy`

## Parity with Lula Kyverno engine
- Ability to target a cluster - Done
- Define target for execution - Apiversion - kind - namespace
- Define exclusions - namespaces or namespaces and resources
- Write rego for processing container in pod - use rego playground
- Ability to target static manifest

## Testing
- Create/connect to a cluster
- Deploy the demo workloads
    - `kubectl apply -f demo/`
- Run the main.go
    - `go run main.go`
- Should result in 2 policy matches and 1 policy no match

## Current Thoughts

- What does rego/OPA offer us as a solution?
    - Rego
    > Rego queries, put simply, ask questions of data stored in OPA. Rego policies then evaluate whether data complies with, or violates, the expected state of a system 
    - OPA
    > OPA is essentially a flexible engine that not only enables you to enumerate and write policies but also has powerful search capabilities that donâ€™t require the learning of any new custom syntax (as with other databases, for example) that can be applied to any JSON data set.
    - Together: A domain agnostic engine for processing JSON data and matching against 

- What does a match indicate?
    - Maybe this doesn't  matter as much as users can write rego independent of this auditor
- How will I retrieve data?
    - Domains
        - Kubernetes
        - AWS
    - Syntax
        - Custom?
        - How do I select which resources to inspect or exclude?


## Execution

- Lock down namespaces and apigroups to a single entry for now
- Per target (loop)
    - per kind (loop)
        - Call getresourcesdynamically()
        - append each iteration to slice of items

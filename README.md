## Current Thoughts

- What does rego/OPA offer us as a solution?
    - Rego
    > Rego queries, put simply, ask questions of data stored in OPA. Rego policies then evaluate whether data complies with, or violates, the expected state of a system 
    - OPA
    > OPA is essentially a flexible engine that not only enables you to enumerate and write policies but also has powerful search capabilities that donâ€™t require the learning of any new custom syntax (as with other databases, for example) that can be applied to any JSON data set.

- What does a match indicate?
    - Maybe this doesn't  matter as much as users can write rego independent of this auditor
- How will I retrieve data?
    - Domains
        - Kubernetes
        - AWS
    - Syntax
        - Custom?
        - How do I select which resources to inspect or exclude?
